## Analysis of `congressional_speech_analyzer.py` Output (Top 50 bigrams)

### Shared Themes
- Both parties' top bigrams include `united_states`, `mr._president`, `american_people`, `president_trump`, `small_business(es)`, `public_health`, `law_enforcement`, `quorum_call`, `u.s._senate`, `house_managers`, `george_floyd`, `cares_act`, and `healthcare_workers`, reflecting shared procedural language and the common focus on COVID-19 relief, policing, and impeachment proceedings.

### Democratic Patterns
- Democrats frequently combine references to the Trump administration with accountability-oriented language: `president_trump`, `trump_'s`, `trump_administration`, `donald_trump`, `leader_mcconnell`, `senate_republicans`, and `republican_colleagues` appear alongside institutional bigrams such as `supreme_court`, `judiciary_committee`, and `u.s._senate`.
- Policy and rights-focused bigrams surfaced prominently: `climate_change`, `civil_rights`, `policing_act`, `war_powers`, `unemployment_insurance`, and `small_business(es)` indicate emphasis on pandemic response, environmental issues, and civil liberties following the George Floyd protests.

### Republican Patterns
- Republicans share the pandemic and procedural base but introduce issue-specific clusters around conservation legislation and party contrasts: `great_american`, `american_outdoors`, `outdoors_act`, `water_conservation`, `conservation_fund`, `national_parks`, `public_lands`, and `national_park` reference the Great American Outdoors Act push of mid-2020.
- Partisan contrasts appear via `speaker_pelosi`, `house_democrats`, `democratic_colleagues`, and security-oriented references `communist_party`, `chinese_communist`, suggesting messaging framed around opposition to Democratic leadership and concerns about China during the pandemic.

### Takeaways
- The overlap in procedural and pandemic vocabulary highlights a shared legislative agenda dominated by COVID-19 relief, Senate processes, and impeachment management.
- Divergences arise in framing: Democrats lean toward oversight and civil-rights discourse (including direct critiques of President Trump and Senate leadership), while Republicans foreground conservation achievements and critiques of Democratic figures and China.
